## FORK ##

Thanks dev for forking Gitskarios!

Since now, if you want to use your own version of Gitskarios, you should generate specific App on Github

[Github OAuth](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

    If you want distinct apps for debug and release, you should generate two applications.

In order to use this sdk, you must enable three metadata keys in your `AndroidManifest.xml`

``` groovy
<meta-data
    android:name="com.alorma.github.sdk.client"
    android:value="@string/gh_client_id"/>

<meta-data
    android:name="com.alorma.github.sdk.secret"
    android:value="@string/gh_client_secret"/>

<meta-data
    android:name="com.alorma.github.sdk.oauth"
    android:value="@string/gh_client_callback"/>
```

In Gitskarios, this keys are hidden from repository, so you should create your own string files, or place it directly in `value`
